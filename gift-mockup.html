    <div id="text">This is the mock up for the gift that I am planning to make for my mom. The present is going to be lots of pictures of her throughout the different stages of her life. As shown above, at the moment I am including four different stages of her life. For each one, I will attempt to find images of my mom at each of these stages in her life. When you click on the image, it takes you to a separate page that automatically chooses a random image from the array that I create. My mom will love this present because she loves looking back at old pictures and it will be fun for her to look back at some of the pictures  of her that have been taken throughout her life.</div>
