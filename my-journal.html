        <p>Hi guys! This is my journal. I will be writing here every once in a while.</p>

    	<p>I have so much work today, but it isn't actually that bad. I have science test today, a math test tomorrow, and a precis for history due tomorrow as well. The science test will probably be hard and the math should be too, but I think (and hope) I will be okay. Computer Science has been pretty fun and I am enjoying writing this right now. I have an English essay in two weeks, and I'm hoping that I will end up doing well on that. For outside of school stuff, I hope that the Rays beat the Astros tonight because the Yankees play the winner of the game. I will write more when I have more stuff to write. </p>
